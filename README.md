====================
A place to put the games I develop with "the other" SmallBASIC version 11.5 Source Forge (for Windows)

War and Peace.bas

Yesterday, 10/29/14, I was browsing "SmallBasic" search here and started to check out Small Basic MS code. I ran into some card game that required extra array(s) to "shuffle" cards. "You don't need all that.", I thought.

Next thing I know, I am writing up a game I call "War and Peace" because it is a twist on the classic card game, War.

It has a neat function for getting cards from deck, until deck is empty, no shuffling! I might reuse for other card games.

Of course, in the Old West, you could get shot for not dealing from the top of the deck. But this isn't the Old West anymore, it's the New World. Who cares how the cards come as long as they are random?

This will be my first attempt to (push or pull)? get my file in laptop up here on hub.
