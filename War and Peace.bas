' The function could prove handy for any BASIC Gamer
' You can add your own Timer and make it a game of speed and accuracy, blah, blah, blah
' I just want to prove you don't have to shuffle the cards

'For MS Small Basic, where you see Print or ? substitute TextWindow.(I forget the rest)
' FI is End IF, ELIF is ElseIF, I am not remembering the new terms that well
' RND is Math.(something)
